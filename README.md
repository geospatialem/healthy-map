<a href="http://geospatialem.github.io/healthy-map/">Healthy Map Template</a>
==============

A proposed template design for mapping health and non-health data together. In particular to see points, such as weather stations, and polygons, such as aggregated health data, overlayed on one map together.

*The template utilizes the <a href="https://github.com/bmcbride/bootleaf">Bootleaf</a> template, a compilation of the <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/">Leaflet</a> libraries.*
